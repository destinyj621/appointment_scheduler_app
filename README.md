#Appointment Scheduler App

A dental office in my community has requested an app that will allow patients to schedule appointments. Currently, the office uses a well-known scheduling service; however, they have emphasized a need for a different application that is cost-effective and tailored to their needs. Additionally, they want an application that is user-friendly to ensure that all patients can use it. This application is still in development and being created using Flutter.

##What has already been completed?

User Authentication

Navigation Bar

Office Hours Page

Appointment Scheduling Form


##What still needs to be completed?

Currently, the application allows users to schedule an appointment; however, the backend isn’t completed yet. I still need to make it so that appointments can’t be scheduled at the same time. I intend to adjust the UI so that users can select from a list of available appointments. Also, I need to debug the email confirmation. I also need to make some cosmetic changes and add the company’s logo.

##How to run the project?

1. Download and extract the file
2. Install Android Studio and Flutter
3. Once installed, click the three dots on the left and click Virtual Device Manager. Click the + at the top. Choose Pixel 8 Pro. Press Next.  Press Next. Press Finish.
4. Under Device Manager, run the Pixel 8 Pro emulator. Close Device Manager.
5. Go to Open. Select the downloaded folder.
6. On the left, pubspec.yaml. At the top select Pub get until you get “Process finished with exit code 0” in the console.
7. Make sure the virtual device manager is chosen at the top. Press Run.
8. It may take a minute to open in the emulator.
